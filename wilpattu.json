Spanning over 1,317 square kilometers, Wilpattu is the largest national park in the country, encompassing a mix of dense scrub jungles, open grasslands, and shimmering lakes. One of its distinctive features is the presence of \"villus\" or natural lakes that dot the landscape, providing a vital source of water for the park's rich biodiversity. Wilpattu is celebrated for its diverse array of wildlife, including elusive leopards, majestic elephants, sloth bears, spotted deer, and a myriad of bird species. The park's name, derived from the term \"Wil\" meaning lakes, aptly captures its essence as a haven for both wildlife and water bodies. The expansive terrain, coupled with its relatively undisturbed environment, contributes to the park's significance as a vital conservation area and a prime destination for nature enthusiasts and wildlife lovers alike.",
