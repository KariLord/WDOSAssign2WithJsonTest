            <h2><u>Sri Lankan Leopard</u></h2>
            <p>
                <div class="leopard-intro">
                Leopards (Panthera pardus kotiya), also known as Sri Lankan leopards, are found in various habitats across Sri Lanka. Here are descriptions of three venues where leopards can be commonly found in the country:
                </div>
                <div class="leopard-yala">
                <h3>Yala National Park:</h3>
                Yala National Park, situated in the southeastern part of Sri Lanka, stands out as one of the country's largest and most renowned national parks. The park encompasses diverse ecosystems, including dry monsoon forests, grasslands, and coastal areas, creating an optimal habitat for leopards. Among its various blocks, Block 1 is particularly famous for its high density of leopards, making it one of the best places globally to observe these elusive big cats. Visitors can partake in safari tours during the morning or evening, increasing their chances of encountering leopards, along with other wildlife such as elephants, crocodiles, and diverse bird species.
                </div>
                <div class="leopard-wilpattu">
                <h3>Wilpattu National Park:</h3>
                Located in the northwest of Sri Lanka, Wilpattu National Park holds the distinction of being the country's largest national park. Its landscape is characterized by natural lakes, scrublands, and dense forest patches. The park boasts a significant leopard population, providing visitors with the opportunity to witness these majestic cats in their natural environment. Wilpattu offers a more off-the-beaten-path experience compared to Yala, delivering a sense of wilderness and tranquility. In addition to leopards, the park is home to a variety of other wildlife, including sloth bears, deer, and numerous bird species.
                </div>
                <div class="leopard-hortonplains">
                <h3>Horton Plains National Park:</h3>
                Nestled in the central highlands of Sri Lanka, Horton Plains National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site celebrated for its scenic beauty and unique montane grassland ecosystem. While leopards may not be as commonly spotted here as in Yala or Wilpattu, Horton Plains still hosts a population of these elusive cats. The park's expansive plains and dramatic cliffs provide breathtaking views, and visitors might chance upon leopards while exploring its trails. Horton Plains is also renowned for the World's End viewpoint, where the land drops dramatically, offering stunning panoramic vistas. As with any national park, it is crucial for visitors to adhere to rules and regulations to ensure the conservation of the leopard population and the overall ecosystem.

            <div class="leopard-threat">
                <h3 align="center"> Habitat Loss and Fragmentation</h3>
                <p>Habitat loss and fragmentation occur when natural habitats are altered or destroyed, typically due to human activities such as agriculture, logging, infrastructure development, and urbanization. This process leads to the reduction and division of the original habitat into smaller, isolated patches</p>
            </div>
            <div class="threat-consequences">
                <h3><strong>Consequences</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Loss of Biodiversity: </strong>Habitat loss and fragmentation can result in the decline of plant and animal species, including the Sri Lankan leopard.</li>
                    <li><strong>Genetic Isolation:</strong> Fragmentation can isolate populations, reducing gene flow and genetic diversity, which is crucial for the long-term health and adaptability of species.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disruption of Ecosystem Services:</strong> Natural habitats provide various ecosystem services, and their loss can impact water regulation, pollination, and nutrient cycling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Increased Human-Wildlife Conflict:</strong> As habitats shrink, wildlife may come into closer contact with human settlements, leading to conflicts and negative interactions.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <div class="threat-mechanisms">
                <h3>What mechanisms are taken to reduce the threat</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong> Restoration:</strong>Restoration projects focus on rehabilitating degraded habitats, replanting native vegetation, and creating conditions conducive to the recovery of ecosystems. </li>
                    <li><strong>Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs):</strong>Implementing stringent EIAs before approving development projects ensures that potential impacts on habitats are thoroughly assessed, and mitigation measures are incorporated into the project design.</li>

                <h3 align="center"> Human-Wildlife Conflict</h3>
                <p>Human-wildlife conflict (HWC) refers to the negative interactions between human populations and wildlife, often arising from competition for resources such as food, water, and space. In the context of large predators like leopards, conflict may escalate when these animals prey on domestic livestock, leading to economic losses for local communities and posing a threat to human safety.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="threat-consequences">
                <h3><strong>Consequences</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Livestock Losses:</strong>Habitat loss and fragmentation can result in the decline of plant and animal species, including the Sri Lankan leopard.Predation on domestic animals by wildlife can result in economic hardships for farmers and herders.</li>
                    <li><strong>Human Injuries or Fatalities:</strong> Direct confrontations between humans and wildlife can lead to injuries or, in extreme cases, fatalities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Negative Attitudes Towards Wildlife:</strong> Human-wildlife conflict can foster negative perceptions of wildlife, potentially leading to retaliatory killings or a lack of support for conservation efforts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Displacement of Wildlife:</strong>In some cases, conflict may result in the displacement of wildlife from their natural habitats, impacting their populations and ecological roles.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong> Livestock Protection Measures:</strong>Introducing measures to protect livestock, such as secure enclosures, guard animals, and predator-proof fencing, can reduce predation and economic losses for farmers. </li>
                    <li><strong>Early Warning Systems:</strong>Developing and implementing early warning systems, which may include technologies like motion-sensor cameras or community alerts, can provide timely information about wildlife presence and help farmers take preventive measures.</li>
